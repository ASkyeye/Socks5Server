# Socks5Server
Windows C/C++ Socks5 Server

Partly implemented RFC 1928 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928) / SOCKS Protocol Version 5 under C/C++ on Windows. This might be useful for other projects in the future.

BIND/UDP mode or Socks4 is not supported at the moment. Should be fairly easy to add the changes.
